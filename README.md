# 22.10 LAB*: Program: Cooking measurement converter
Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.2f}')

(1) Prompt the user for the number of cups of lemon juice, water, and agave nectar needed to make lemonade. Prompt the user to specify the number of servings the recipe yields. Output the ingredients and serving size. (Submit for 2 points).

Note: This zyLab outputs a newline after each user-input prompt. For convenience in the examples below, the user's input value is shown on the next line, but such values don't actually appear as output when the program runs.
